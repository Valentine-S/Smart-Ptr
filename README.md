# Unique and Shared Pouinter
### Valentine Shidlovskiy

To make it easy to run this file I have included the executables
I used to test if my unique and shared pointer implementation worked properly.
When complining the exectuables I also inclued memory sanitizers that would print 
out memory leaks if there were any present.
